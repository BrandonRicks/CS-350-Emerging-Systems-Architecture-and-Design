# CS-350 Portfolio - SingleByte Project

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of this project was to use a single byte stored in a serial buffer. Characters were iterated using a switch/case to allow the user to type 'on' or 'off' into the terminal, which would control the LED on the board, based on whether 'on' or 'off' were typed.

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did pretty well with the switch/case, especially for my first real attempt at one. It took a bit of trial and error, but came together quite nicely.

## Where could you improve?
The code could be simplified even further if I had put the inputs in the transition arc, rather than within if statements.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I'm adding more experience to using both CCS, as well as experience in programming the MCU. Prior to this class, I had never used one before, so there was a lot of learning involved. This, along with other projects, will be useful to look back to at later dates.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Much of the skills surrounding code structure, as well as my understanding of embedded systems, will be very useful moving forward.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Though I have a habit of sometimes overthinking a solution, I try to keep code clean and easy to follow whenever possible. This code could be adjusted relatively easily to alter the required output by adding or removing to the switch/case.

# CS-350 Portfolio - Thermostat Project

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project makes use of many different peripherals built into the board, combining much of the work in the class together, along with some new information. It involved building the code and functionality of the board into a working thermostat, where temperature changes to the sensor on the board would cause an LED to turn on and a value to change, simulating a heater turning on.

## What did you do particularly well?
After lots of troubleshooting and trying various methods, I feel like I did well on the structure of the code and the created variables. The code is easily to follow, well commented, and the variables make sense for their intended purpose.

## Where could you improve?
As stated above, my tendancy to overthink a solution someitmes led to me rewriting this program more than once. I also have room to improve on understanding how certain peripherals can be coded.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found a lot of value in the discussion surrounding asking questions or clarification on the project. Many of the posts were applicable to my understanding of the assignment, as well as the value of asking questions to my professor. I see value in bouncing ideas and questions off of your peers. Reading the header files of the drivers in use is also very helpful.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
See a sensor on the board change the output in ther terminal, alongside the LED changing was an exciting thing. It was interesting to see all of these moving parts come together and work as intended. While working on this project, I began to understand more and more how you code peripherals to work together, particularly combining button presses with custom variables, and all of these working with the temperature sensor.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code in this project is clean and easy to follow. I added a lot fo comments to explain lines of code, variables, functionality, etc., and kept it all logically put together. The while loop shows how each check of the timer works, and is easy to alter or build upon. It wouldn't take much work to add more tasks, alter times, adjust default values, etc.
